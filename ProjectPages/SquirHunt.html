<h2>About the Game:</h2>
<h3>SquirrelHunt is a game created by myself, Edward Simendinger, JianJie Liu, and Ge Gao. This game was inspired by a Facebook page “Squirrels of Tufts”. This idea was inspired by the episode “Nosedive” from the series Black Mirror in which everyone has a ranking and as they meet people are able to rate each other based on their interactions. We imagined this game being a way in which people are able to take pictures of squirrels and depending on their quality, other players are allowed to rank them and thus create a gallery full of images of squirrels in a similar style to the website imgur.</h3>

<h2>Technology:</h2>
<h3>For this project we used the front end software Bootstrap and for the backend we used MongoDB. This app’s database is located in Heroku.com and uses JQuery to request and send data to and from the database.</h3>

<h2>Designing the Schema:</h2>
<h3>When we first approached this we needed a system of containing data and had only learned MongoDB. We created a schema in which each record in the database was a person, and inside held all of the data of each person. These data include user information and the array of photos with all related photo data such as photo data, ratings, comments and more. In retrospect we would have used a relational model so that all the data was not in one place, and potentially would have used SQL.</h3>

<h2>Current Status:</h2>
<h3>SquirHunt is currently functional at the website listed at the top of the page. It does not have the full functionality that was desired.</h3>

<h2>Things We Didn’t Get to Do:</h2>
<h3>In the time we worked on the project, Edward and I implemented more backend functions than we were able to link to the frontend given the time constraints of presentation and so we are now going back to fix current issues and expand upon other functions already written but not implemented in the frontend.</h3>

<h2>Afterthoughts:</h2>
<h3>After this project’s ‘completion’, I’ve learned that constant communication between the frontend developers and the backend developers is key to a functional website. Edward and I went too deep in functions in the backend and thus lost track of our deadlines in terms of linking the backend functions to the frontend. In retrospect, we should have created one function at a time and linked each so that the base foundation of the website would be strong and then could have more tinkering on top of it rather than trying to put it all together at once.</h3>
