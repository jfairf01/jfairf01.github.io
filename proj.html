		<h5>Facial Recognizer; <a href="https://facial-recognizer.herokuapp.com">https://facial-recognizer.herokuapp.com</a></h5>

		<p class="subtitle">Role: Full Stack (December 2017)</p>
		<p class="aboutStyle"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was in association with my Object Oriented Programming for Graphical User Interface class. This project was inspired as a proof of concept from an article I read that contemplated the idea that one day our facial recognition would be used instead of a passport for travel. If this were to happen (and currently most international travel includes a portrait of the traveller), then if these airports were able to cross-reference a database of missing persons reports using a facial recognition API I have used here, it may help to reduce the incidents of human trafficking.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">Technologies Used: <span class="aboutStyle">Heroku, PostgreSQL, Flask, Jinja2, Semantic UI, Kairos (Facial Recognition API), Cloudinary (cloud-based photo storage API), Python (Web Scraper)</span></p>

		<h5>House; <a href="Google Play Thingy">Google Play Link</a></h5>

		<p class="subtitle">Role: Web API/Database Management (October 2017-December 2017)</p>
		<p class="aboutStyle"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was in association with my Mobile Development class. I worked on a team of three to create a house managing application. The need for this app comes out of constant passive aggression between housemates in college about the state of chores in the house, and so this Android application allows for the creation of accounts, houses, and chores to coordinate the responsibilities of house members. This is in production and may be downloaded at the <a href="Google Play Thingy">link</a> above.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">Technologies Used: <span class="aboutStyle">Heroku, PostgreSQL, Flask, React Native</span></p>

		<br/>

		<h5>University Reservation System; <a href="http://urs-tufts.herokuapp.com/">http://urs-tufts.herokuapp.com/</a></h5>

		<p class="subtitle">Role: Full Stack (January 2017-May 2017)</p>
		<p class="aboutStyle"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was in association with my Web Engineering class. I worked with a group of three to create a new reservation system for Tufts University that allows users to easily reserve spaces and equipment on campus by routing requests and keeping track of security clearance to quickly, safely, and effectively allow groups on campus to reserve materials. Only Spaces works as it was a proof of concept project. (For a reservation, select the Tufts Medford/Somerville Campus and a Classroom as the Space Type)</p>

		<h5>SquirHunt; <a href="https://squirrelhunt.herokuapp.com/">https://squirrelhunt.herokuapp.com/</a></h5>
		<p class="subtitle">Role: Backend Development(November 2016)</p>
		<p class="aboutStyle"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was in association with my Web Programming class. I worked with a group of four to create a website application that allows users to sign up or log in to post photos of squirrels including the location of their sighting. From there, users will be able to enter the galllery and see all squirrels (arranged by most recent) and rate/comment on the squirrel photos. </p>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">Technologies Used: <span class="aboutStyle">Heroku, MongoDB, NodeJS</span></p>
