	<h2>Early Childhood:</h2>
	<p>I was born in Naboo back in the day and was the third child making our family’s total size five members.</p>

	<h2>Childhood:</h2>
	<p>I attended the same school and lived in the same house for all of my childhood. I studied in the Elementary School of Naboo from age 5 to 9 until I was found to have the power of the force.</p>

	<h2>Early Adolescent:</h2>
	<p>At age 9 my parents sent me to the far away world of Dagobah to study the Force under the wise teachings of Yoda. </p>

	<h2>Current Time:</h2>
	<p>I’m currently a college student enrolled in Tufts University. I’ve managed to conceal my powers this long and no one suspects that I’ve been trained as a master Jedi and so I will continue to lay low until the power of darkness approaches and I will battle it once more.</p>
